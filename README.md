# Python Crash Course Exercises Projects

I have been coding in python for roughly 6 months now and I figured it was time to start really building up my GitHub account. So, I decided to go back through one of the books I used to learn python. I chose to record the code to the problems from this book becuase I actually really liked this book and I think that it would be a great start for people just getting into the language. Also, while some of the problems are definitly a little too basic if anyone has at least some coding knowledge I do
suggest you go through them and try to write the answers different ways because there is always more than one way to solve a problem!
