# 6.1 Person: use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their first name, last name, age,
# and the city in which they live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece of
# information stored in your dictionary.



# 6.2 Favorite Number: Use a dictionary to store people's favorite numbers. Think of five names, and use them as keys in your
# dictionary. Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. Print each person's
# name and their favorite number. For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.


# 6.3 Glossary: A python dicitonary can be used to model an actual dictionary. However, to avoid confusion, let's call it
# a glossary.
# - Think of five programming words you've learned about in the previous chapters. Use these words as the keys in your
# glossary, and then store their meanings as values.
# - Print each word and it's meaning as neatly formatted output. You might print the word followed by a colon and then its
# meaning , or print the word on one line and then print its meaning indented on a second line. Use the newline character (\n)
# to insert a blank line between each word-meaning pair in your output.


# 6.4 Glossary 2: Now that you know how to loop through a dictionary, clean up the code from exercise 6.3 by replacing 
# your series of print statements with a loop that runs through the dictionary's keys and values. When you're sure that
# your loop works, add five more python terms to your glossary. When you run your program again, these new words and meanings
# should automatically be included in the output.


# 6.5 Rivers: Make a dictionary containing three major rivers and the country each river runs through. One key-value pair
# might be 'nile' : 'egypt'
# - Use a loop to print a sentence about each river, such as 'The NIle runs through Egypt'
# - Use a loop to print the name of each river included in the dictionary.
# - Use a loop to print the name of each country in the dictionary.


# 6.6 Polling: Use the code Use the code in favorite_languages.py
# - Make a list of people who should take the favorite languages poll. Include some names that are already in the dicitonary
# and some that are not.
# - Loop through the list of people who should take the poll. If they have already taken the poll, print a message thanking 
# them for responding. If they have not yet taken the poll, print a message inviting them to take the poll.


# 6.7 People: Start with the program you wrote for exercise 6.1. Make two new dicitonaries representing different people,
# and store all three dictionaries in a list called people. Loop through your list of people. As you loop through the list,
# print everything you know about each person.


# 6.8 Pets: Make several dicitonaries, where the name of each dictionary is the name of a pet. In each dictionary, include
# the kind of animal and the owner's name . Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and 
# as you doprint everything you know about each pet.


# 6.9 Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys in the dicitonary, and
# store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends to name
# a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print each person's name and their favorite places.


# 6.10 Favorite Numbers: Modify your program from exercise 6.2 so each person can have more than one favorite number. Then
# print each person's name along with their favorite numbers.
